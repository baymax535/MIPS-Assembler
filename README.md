## MIPS Assembler
#### Team : Labib Alam, Jacob Huang, Dennis Smith.

Welcome to the repository for our MIPS assembler project! This Java-based project serves as an assembler for MIPS assembly language instructions, converting them into machine code for execution on MIPS architecture. Leveraging our knowledge of computer architecture and low-level programming, we meticulously designed and implemented this assembler to ensure accurate translation and optimal performance.
### 
Within this repository, you'll find a comprehensive collection of source code files, documentation, and resources detailing the functionality, usage, and design decisions of the assembler. Each component is carefully organized to facilitate easy navigation and understanding. The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust Java-based MIPS assembler. By intimately understanding the relationship between symbolic assembly language and low-level machine code, this project aims to provide a deep insight into computer architecture and programming concepts.

### Key Features
Focused Instruction Subset: The assembler targets a specific subset of MIPS instructions, including arithmetic, logical, control flow, and memory access instructions, among others.
Single-Line Assembly Conversion: This milestone concentrates on processing single-line MIPS assembly instructions and accurately generating the corresponding machine code.
Efficient Command-Line Execution: The program can be executed from the command line, taking a single-line MIPS assembly instruction as an argument and producing the respective machine code.
